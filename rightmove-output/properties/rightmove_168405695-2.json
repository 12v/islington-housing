  "feesApplyText": "Tenants Fee Schedule for Assured Shorthold Tenancies (AST's) signed on or after 1st June 2019 PERMITTED PAYMENTS PRE-TENANCY Holding Deposit (per tenancy): Equal to 1 weeks (agreed) rent, to reserve a property. Please note this will be withheld if any relevant person (including any guarantor(s)) withdraw from the tenancy, fail a right to rent check, provide materially significant false or misleading information or fail to sign their tenancy (and/or Deed of Guarantee) within 15 calendar days (or other Deadline for Agreement as mutually agreed in writing). Should the Tenant(s) withdraw or fail referencing due to non-disclosure and/or falsified references this fee will not be returned. It will be used as a contribution towards your Tenancy Deposit, if the Tenancy proceeds to move in/completion. Deposit: 5 week's rent if the annual rent is equal to or less than \u00a350,000, and 6 weeks otherwise. PERMITTED PAYMENTS DURING THE TENANCY Rent: Paid as agreed in the terms set out in your tenancy agreement. Unpaid Rent: If the rent remains due for more than 14 days from the due date interest will be charged on any amounts of rent due and in arrears at the rate of 3% above the Bank of England annual base rate calculated on a day to day basis from the date the same shall become due until payment in full is made and recover the interest as though it were rent. Amendments to a Tenancy Agreement (i.e. change of tenant) during the tenancy or at the renewal stage: If the landlord agrees to vary the terms of the tenancy, referencing on the incoming tenant will need to be completed, and a Deed of Assignment or new Tenancy Agreement will be drawn up in order to legally execute the changes, depending on the amendment required. \u00a350.00 including VAT + any reasonable extra costs incurred if applicable. Utilities: Paid as agreed in the terms set out in your tenancy agreement. Loss or Damage to Keys or Security Devices: A reasonable charge depending on related costs. This will include: the cost of replacing a single key or device, the cost of getting a locksmith to attend if necessary, to gain access or change the locks, and any other costs incurred directly in relation to this. Payments may be levied upfront. Early Termination: Should the tenant wish to leave their contract early and the landlord accept, they shall be liable to the landlord's costs in re-letting the property, as well as all rent and all utilities due under the tenancy until the start date of the replacement tenancy. These costs will be no more than the maximum amount of rent outstanding on the tenancy. PERMITTED PAYMENTS AFTER THE TENANCY Claims for Damage: Costs will be sought to put the landlord or agent back in the position they could have been had the tenant carried out all their obligations as set out in their tenancy agreement. The costs of such damages will be claimed from the tenant's deposit at the end of the tenancy.
